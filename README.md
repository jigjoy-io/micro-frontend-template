# Template for Micro Frontends with Module Federation

This repository template leverages the module federation paradigm to facilitate efficient code sharing across micro frontends. It uses Webpack as the bundler, TypeScript for type safety, Babel for JavaScript transpilation, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Designed to streamline the setup process, this template accelerates the creation of new repositories for micro frontend applications.

## Creating a New Micro-Frontend

Run the following command in your terminal, replacing name_of_new_project with your desired project name:

`npx degit git@github.com:jigjoy-io/module-federation-template.git#main name_of_new_project`

## Running Instructions 

To run a new micro-frontend project follow these steps:

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into your new project directory:

`cd name_of_new_project`

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

`yarn install`

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

`yarn start`

Your new micro-frontend project is now set up and running. You can start developing your application using Webpack, TypeScript, Babel, and Tailwind CSS.

## Build the Project

To build the project, run:

`yarn build`

This will create a `dist` folder where the built files will be regenerated each time you run this command.
